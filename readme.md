# Spotifiness

## Getting Started

### Using Yarn
-   First of all clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/klefcodes/spotifiness.git`

-   Then you have to `cd spotifiness`

-   Run `cp .env.example .env` and make any changes necessary in that file

- If you don't have yarn installed click the following link https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install.

-   Run the 👇🏼 command
    ```sh
    $ yarn install
    ```
    This will install the dependencies meant for the api to run smoothly.
-   Lastly you need to run 👇🏼

    ```sh
    $ yarn dev
    ```
    This serves the api by default on [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333/api/v1) and the client side on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

    Happy coding 👨🏼‍💻
